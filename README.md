Food Hub App
Overview
The Food Hub app is a mobile-first web application designed to help users discover and select food categories (e.g., Fast Food, Village Center, Local Dishes). This project is part of a Capstone Project, focusing on creating a user-friendly interface with responsive design. The app includes a login page and a category selection dashboard, with plans for further development.
Features

Login Page: A simple form for user authentication with email and password fields, social login options (Facebook, Google, Twitter), and a "Forgot password?" link.
Category Dashboard: A grid layout displaying food categories with images, ratings, and a notification indicator, featuring a search bar and user profile access.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both mobile and desktop views using CSS flexbox and media query principles.
Basic Interactivity: Click events for the menu and user avatar, with placeholder alerts for future functionality.

Technologies Used

HTML5: For structuring the app's content.
CSS3: For styling, including responsive layouts and custom designs.
JavaScript: For basic form validation and interactivity.
Design Tool: Figma (recommended) for initial high-fidelity designs.
